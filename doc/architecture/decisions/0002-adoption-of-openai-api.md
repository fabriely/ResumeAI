# 2. Adoption of OpenAI API

Date: 2025-02-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires a reliable and high-quality AI model for text processing, analysis, and summarization. Various AI APIs were considered, each with its own strengths and limitations. The team needed a solution that balances ease of use, quality, and documentation.

## Decision

The team decided to adopt OpenAI's API for AI-powered text processing.

## Justification

The choice was made based on the following key factors:
- Quality Benchmark: OpenAI's models are widely recognized as industry-leading in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
- Well-Documented API: OpenAI provides extensive documentation, making integration and usage straightforward.
- Ease of Use: The API design is user-friendly and allows for quick implementation within our project.

## Alternatives Considered

Google Gemini API
- Pros: Provides a larger number of input tokens compared to OpenAI.
- Cons: API documentation and ease of use were perceived as slightly less intuitive by the team.

## Consequences

Pros:
- High-quality AI outputs enhance the user experience.
- Fast and easy integration due to well-structured API documentation.

Cons:
- OpenAI API is a paid service, requiring budget allocation.
- Fewer input tokens compared to competitors may pose constraints on processing larger texts.
