# 5. Adoption of Python for Backend Development

Date: 2025-02-21

## Status

Accepted and Implemented

## Context

The project requires a backend programming language that ensures compatibility with the OpenAI API and provides a well-supported development ecosystem. The team evaluated different languages to determine the best fit for maintainability, integration, and scalability.

## Decision

The team decided to adopt Python as the backend programming language.

## Justification

The choice was made based on the following key factors:
- OpenAI API Compatibility: Python has strong support for AI and machine learning libraries, making it the best choice for integrating with OpenAI's API.
- Widely Used & Supported: Python is a popular language with an extensive ecosystem, large community, and comprehensive documentation.
- Ease of Development: Python’s simplicity and readability enhance development speed and maintainability.

## Alternatives Considered

JavaScript (Node.js)
- Pros: Non-blocking I/O makes it well-suited for real-time applications.
- Cons: Less common in AI/ML applications and may require additional dependencies for seamless OpenAI API integration.

## Consequences

Pros:
- Seamless integration with AI-related tools and libraries.
- Easy to learn and maintain due to Python’s clean syntax.
- Strong community support and extensive third-party libraries.

Cons:
- May have lower performance for highly concurrent applications compared to Node.js.
