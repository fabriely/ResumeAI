# 6. Adoption of Figma for Wireframing and Prototyping

Date: 2025-02-21

## Status

Accepted and Implemented

## Context

The project requires a design tool for wireframing, prototyping, and collaboration among team members. The tool should be accessible, easy to use, and support real-time collaboration.

## Decision

The team decided to adopt Figma as the primary design tool for wireframing and prototyping.

## Justification

The choice was made based on the following key factors:
- Free to Use: Figma offers a free plan that covers essential design and collaboration needs.
- Ease of Use: The interface is intuitive, making it easy for designers and developers to collaborate.
- Cloud-Based Collaboration: Enables real-time editing and feedback without the need for additional software installation.
- Industry Standard: Widely adopted in the design community, ensuring better compatibility with design workflows.

## Alternatives Considered

Adobe XD
- Pros: Good integration with Adobe Creative Cloud.
- Cons: Not entirely free, limited real-time collaboration compared to Figma.

## Consequences

Pros:
- Encourages efficient collaboration between designers and developers.
- No installation required; accessible from any device with an internet connection.
- Supports component-based design for consistency.

Cons:
- Requires an internet connection for full functionality.
