# 4. Adoption of React, Tailwind and Typescript for Frontend Development

Date: 2025-02-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires a modern and scalable frontend technology stack that supports rapid development, maintainability, and performance. The team evaluated various frontend frameworks and styling approaches to find the best fit.

## Decision

The team decided to adopt React as the frontend framework, Tailwind CSS for styling, and TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

## Justification

The choice was made based on the following key factors:
React:
- Component-based architecture simplifies development and enhances reusability.
- Large ecosystem and strong community support.
- Good performance with efficient rendering using the Virtual DOM.

Tailwind CSS:
- Utility-first approach enables rapid UI development with minimal custom CSS.
- Encourages design consistency and maintainability.
- Highly customizable while remaining lightweight.

TypeScript:
- Adds static typing, reducing runtime errors and improving code quality.
- Enhances developer experience with better tooling and autocomplete support.

## Alternatives Considered

Vue.js
- Pros: Simpler learning curve, built-in state management.
- Cons: Smaller ecosystem compared to React.

Bootstrap + SCSS
- Pros: Predefined styles for faster UI development.
- Cons: Less flexible and modular compared to Tailwind CSS.

JavaScript (without TypeScript)
- Pros: No additional tooling required.
- Cons: Lacks type safety, increasing the risk of runtime errors.

## Consequences

Pros:
- Improved development speed with reusable components and utility-first styling.
- Enhanced maintainability with TypeScript's type checking.
- Strong ecosystem support with a large number of libraries and tools.

Cons:
- Requires familiarity with React, Tailwind, and TypeScript for new developers.
