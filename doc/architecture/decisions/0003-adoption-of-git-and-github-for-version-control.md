# 3. Adoption of Git and GitHub for Version Control

Date: 2025-02-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires a robust and widely accepted version control system to manage code changes and facilitate collaboration among team members. Various version control systems were considered, each with its own strengths and limitations. The team needed a solution that is reliable, well-supported, and widely used.

## Decision

The team decided to adopt Git as the version control system and GitHub as the repository hosting platform.

## Justification

The choice was made based on the following key factors:
- Industry Standard: Git is the de facto standard for version control, widely used across the software development industry.
- Collaboration & Sharing: GitHub provides an easy-to-use interface and extensive features for team collaboration.
- Well-Documented & Supported: Both Git and GitHub have extensive documentation and a large community for support.

## Alternatives Considered

GitLab
- Pros: Provides built-in CI/CD and more flexibility in repository hosting.
- Cons: Slightly steeper learning curve and less widespread usage compared to GitHub.

Bitbucket
- Pros: Good integration with Atlassian tools such as Jira.
- Cons: Less popular for open-source projects and a smaller user base.

## Consequences

Pros:
- Standardized version control practices make onboarding and collaboration easier.
- GitHub's robust ecosystem and integrations streamline development workflows.

Cons:
- Requires a GitHub account and familiarity with Git commands for new team members.
